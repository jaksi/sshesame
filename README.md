# sshesame

An easy to set up and use SSH honeypot, a fake SSH server that lets anyone in and logs their activity

`sshesame` accepts and logs SSH connections and activity (channels, requests), without doing anything on the host (e.g. executing commands, making network requests).

## Installation and usage

### From source

```
go get github.com/jaksi/sshesame
sshesame [-config sshesame.yaml] [-data_dir /etc/sshesame]
```

### Docker

Images are automatically published to [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/jaksi/sshesame/pkgs/container/sshesame).

```
docker run -it --rm -p 127.0.0.1:2022:2022 -v sshesame-data:/data [-v $PWD/sshesame.yaml:/config.yaml] ghcr.io/jaksi/sshesame
```

### Configuration

A configuration file can optionally be passed using the `-config` flag.
Without specifying one, sane defaults will be used and RSA, ECDSA and Ed25519 host keys will be generated and stored in the directory specified in the `-data_dir` flag.

A [sample configuration file](sshesame.yaml) with explanations for the configuration options is included.
A [minimal configuration file](openssh.yaml) which tries to mimic an OpenSSH server is also included.

Debug and error logs are written to standard error. Activity logs by default are written to standard out, unless the `logging.file` config option is set.
